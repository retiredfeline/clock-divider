# Small clock divider board

These are the Kicad design files for a CD4060 based [small clock divider](https://hackaday.io/project/202239-small-clock-divider).

## Notes

A crystal (up to about 1.5 MHz) can be used, or an external clock source can be connected. A solder jumper enables the latter.

One of the divisor outputs can be routed with a solder jumper to drive the output transistor which is open collector.
